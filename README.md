## Figma API Automation.

## Technology
This project was made with React v16.12 and Node.js. Nodemon is used to allow the site to fast refresh during development. The Node server calls the Figma API, parses the JSON response, and then React displays the frame title and image in a scrollable grid.

## Installation.
Clone this repo to your computer and run `npm install` in both the root directory and inside the `client` folder.
You'll also need to add your own API keys + File IDs to `server.js` in the root.
After you have done that you'll need to run `npm start` in both the root and the `client` folder to start the two servers.
